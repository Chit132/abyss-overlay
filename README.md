## Recommended Usage
Open the overlay and put it on either the top left or top right of your screen. Select your client. Adjust any settings you want. Make sure to run `/who` in lobby when not all players in the lobby are registered in the overlay. Leave the rest up to the overlay :)

## Features

- Resizable, movable, and minimizable
- Works with most clients: Badlion, Lunar, PvPLounge, Labymod, Vanilla, Forge
- Changable color and opacity
- Automatically switches between size modes when game start or someone joins. You can also manually do this
- Sends you a notification when game starts so you do not miss out if you are tabbed out
